# Sales Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This Sales Forecasting project is designed to analyze and predict sales for a retail chain using historical data. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a sales forecasting model. Additionally, it includes a dashboard for visualizing key sales data and insights.

## Repository Contents
- `Sales forecasting project Final Notebook (1).ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing detailed analysis, data preprocessing, and modeling for sales forecasting.
- `final app.py`: A Python script for a Dash-based web application, used for visualizing the sales data.
- `Train.csv`: The dataset used for training and analysis, containing detailed sales data along with product and outlet information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook for running the .ipynb file
- Required Python libraries (listed in the requirements document)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
1. Launch the Jupyter notebook to explore and run the analyses and models:
   ```
   jupyter notebook 'Sales forecasting project Final Notebook (1).ipynb'
   ```
2. To view the sales data dashboard, run the Dash application:
   ```
   python final app.py
   ```

## Data Description
The `Train.csv` file contains various features related to retail products and outlets, such as item weight, fat content, visibility, type, MRP, outlet size, location type, and historical sales figures.

## Usage
- The Jupyter notebook is the core part of this project, providing comprehensive data analysis and forecasting models.
- The Python script (`final app.py`) is used for visualizing the data with an interactive dashboard.
